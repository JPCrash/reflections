How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It's a simple matter of viewing the changes and it helps by lettng me know.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Because it can show the process of how a file was created and even what was 
    tried before.  

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Automatic saves can be a double-edged sword because being able to recover is nice 
    but you don't want too many file versions as it's harder to track every minor change.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Application and code releases can span many files, unlike documents such as MS Word or Excel 
    which are all inclusive.  

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Version control gives you an undo that spans the whole solution, not just inside
    individual files.  

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
